# Module 1 Challenge -  Kickastarter Analysis
There are 5 unhidden sheets in the worksheet, the following is an explanation of each:

1. Kickstarter Sheet: Contains all the data with no filters

2. Plays Kickstarter Data Sheet: Contains data filtered by the "plays" subcatgeory" 
3. Outcomes based on goals Sheet: Contains a data table and a line graph for % of successful, % of failed and % of canceled with respect to the the 12 different goal buckets for just the "plays" subcategory. Used Countifs formula to get the number of sucessful, failed, and canceled columns.  Please note that I chose to copy and paste the filtered play data from the original data into a new sheet (Plays Kickstarter data), however we could've got it without doing that by adding an extra rule in the countifs formula that states the column that has the subcategory data should equal plays.

4. Outcomes based on launch Sheet: Contains a pivot table of the monthly number of successful, canceled, failed projects for the "theater" Category.

5. Findings and Conclusion: This is a report of findings, conclusions and limitations of the datasets and graphs found from the outcomes based on goals and outcomes based on launch date sheets.

### Please note that there are hidden sheets, which represent the activities we did in Module 1.
